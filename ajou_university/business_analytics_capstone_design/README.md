# About the Project

The project aims to provide people information on where to go when they are planning to involve in a Sustainable Tourism. As climate change became the biggest issue, the bad effects caused by overtourism in the traveling country also aroused. But there was not enough information on how a traveler can involve in the sustainable tourism.

In the project, our team narrowed the region to Jejudo since we saw negative effects caused by overtourism like rising rents and environmental pollutions in the region.
